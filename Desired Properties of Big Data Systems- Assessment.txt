Robustness and fault tolerance

    -The system shall ingnore any inconsistencies in the data feed.

Low latency reads and updates
    -MeetUp stream is continues, but there were instances of EC2 failure, hence a cesation in loading in S3. This could be improved using higher-tier EC2 machines, or a back-up.

Scalability 
    -The S3/ Spark is capable of handling larger datasets. The limitation is in the front-end. Tableau Public only accommodates 15M rows. In enterprise roll-out, Tableau Desktop is capable of connecting to Amazon EMR and Spark SQL

Generalization

    -The 3NF DataFrames and csv files can be used in different applications

Extensibility
    -The 3NF tables can be expanded in case more data fields are provided by the MeetUp stream

Ad hoc queries
    -Tableau has data download feature, which can be used to extract data from the system.

Minimal maintenance
    -The current system is static and would need frequent refresh since connected to csv files. This can be solved by connecting Tableau directly to Amazon EMR


Debuggability
    -The code is easy to understand and has comments, hence easy to debug. There's also a file on Unix codes used for reference.
